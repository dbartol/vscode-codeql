# CodeQL for Visual Studio Code: Changelog

## 1.0.5

## 1.0.4 - 24 January 2020

- Disable word-based autocomplete by default.
- Add command `CodeQL: Quick Query` for easy query creation without
  having to choose a place in the filesystem to store the query file.

## 1.0.3 - 13 January 2020

- Reduce the frequency of CodeQL CLI update checks to help avoid hitting GitHub API limits of 60 requests per
hour for unauthenticated IPs.
- Fix sorting of result sets with names containing special characters.

## 1.0.2 - 13 December 2019

- Fix rendering of negative numbers in results.

  query history view context menu.

  shown path result.

## 1.0.1 - 21 November 2019

- Change `codeQL.cli.executablePath` to a per-machine setting, so it can no longer be set at the user or workspace level. This helps prevent arbitrary code execution when using a VS Code workspace from an untrusted source.

- Improve the performance of switching between result tables in the CodeQL Query Results view.
- Fix the automatic upgrading of CodeQL databases when using upgrade scripts from the workspace.
